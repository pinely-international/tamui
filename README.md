Tama Denshya UI Kit | Cross-Framework Suite

Why "**tamui**"? - It sounds like **Japanese word** `\_(-_-)_/`

> **Y**ielding elegant reactivity, **o**pen to every framework, **u**nbound by styling dogma, **a**scending beyond convention, **r**ooted in signals, **e**levating interface creation - **g**racefully **a**daptable, **y**et entirely headless.

**tamui** is a modular UI kit built on signal-driven architecture. It gives you the foundation for creating fully reactive components without dictating your design system. Use it as headless primitives, extend it into JSX-styled elements, or even compile it into Web Custom Elements. It is minimal, reactive, and unopinionated - made for developers who want complete control over their interface logic and presentation.

> It means it works in React.

## CSS

Additional useful styles, whether to include these or not is up to you.

**Reset**
Resets all browser default styles, useful for greater control and to make sure styles won't be affected by browser style changes.

```js
import "@denshya/tamui/styles/reset.css"
```
